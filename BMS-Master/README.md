# BMS-Master

Controller board for the FSUK accumulator. Bridges to the daisy-chained
cell-monitor stack (`BMS-Module`, x6) via a BQ79600-Q1, runs the safety logic
(limit checks, SoC estimation, balancing control, fault latch), and talks two
CAN buses — full telemetry, and a summarized feed to the ECU/dashboard.

## Block diagram

![BMS-Master Block Diagram](block-diagram.png)

- SPI to the **BQ79600-Q1 bridge** (plus `SPI_RDY` and `NFAULT` interrupts),
  reading the daisy-chained cell-monitor stack.
- Reads the accumulator **current sensor**.
- Runs **limit checks, SoC estimation, balancing control, fault latch**.
- Drives the **AMS fault relay** directly (not via CAN/ECU) — opens the SDC
  on fault, in both driving and charging states.
- **CAN1**: full telemetry (96 cells, 192 temps, balancing state, I, V).
  **CAN2**: summarized state (SoC, max cell V, max temp, fault code) to
  ECU/dashboard.
- Drives the **isolated charger regulation bus** (opto STOP signal).
- Watched by an **external watchdog** that opens the relay if the MCU hangs.

## MCU selection: STM32G474

Decision: **STM32G474** (fallback **STM32G473**, pin/feature-compatible — only
if G474 is out of stock).

Six other candidates also pass every must-have requirement (see verdict table
below), but G474 is the only one that also meets every nice-to-have: built-in
op-amps/PGAs, most ADCs, deepest CAN buffering.

### Requirements

| # | Requirement | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | At least 2 CAN peripherals | Must | CAN1 = telemetry/diagnostics, CAN2 = ECU/dashboard. Classic CAN or CAN-FD both count. |
| 2 | CAN FD support | Nice | A 64 B CAN-FD frame needs ~7 frames per snapshot vs ~55 on classic CAN, but classic CAN at 1 Mbps already does a full snapshot in ~7 ms. Not a deciding factor. |
| 3 | SPI master for BQ79600-Q1 | Must | One SPI peripheral, plus `SPI_RDY` and `NFAULT` pins. |
| 4 | Hardware FPU | Must | SoC estimation algorithms. |
| 5 | RAM / Flash capacity | Must | Snapshot is ~420 B, plus limit tables, balancing state, fault latch, CAN queues. |
| 6 | Fast multi-channel ADC | Must | Current sensor. |
| 7 | Internal PGA / op-amp | Nice | Only matters for a raw analog shunt amp. A CAN-based or isolated Hall sensor makes this moot. |
| 8 | GPIO: 2 EXTI + relay, watchdog, opto outputs, switch input | Must | `SPI_RDY`, `NFAULT`, AMS relay, watchdog toggle, charger opto, balancing switch. |
| 9 | Deep CAN buffering (non-blocking TX) | Should | Telemetry must never block the safety path (relay, fault latch, watchdog). |

### Candidates evaluated

STM32G474, G473, G491, G431, H503, H523/H563, H723/H743, F446, F405, F413,
F429/F407, G0B1, F303 — spread across ST's current CAN-capable families, plus
F303 as a real precedent (ENNOID-BMS uses it, see
`Reference Docs/Open-Source BMS Projects/README.md`).

Specs are from memory — verify CAN counts, ADC counts, and memory sizes in
CubeMX/datasheet before committing to silicon. H503's CAN count specifically
is unconfirmed.

### Verdict summary

| Variant | Must-haves (of 6) | Should/Nice (of 3) | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **STM32G474** | 6/6 | 3/3 | Pass | **Recommended.** |
| STM32G473 | 6/6 | 3/3 | Pass | Same as G474. Fallback if out of stock. |

| STM32H523/H563 | 6/6 | 2/3 | Pass | Only worth it for a faster core or secure boot. |
| STM32H723/H743 | 6/6 | 2/3 | Pass | Overkill, big packages. |
| STM32F446 | 6/6 | 0/3 | Pass | Best F4 choice. Classic CAN is enough. |

| STM32F429/F407 | 6/6 | 0/3 | Pass | Works, oversized. |
| STM32G0B1 | 4/6 | 2/3 | Fail | No FPU. Minimal-cost option only. |
| STM32F303 | 5/6 | 0/3 | Fail | Only one CAN, shared with USB packet SRAM. |

### Why G474 over the other passing candidates

- F4 and H5/H7 families have no built-in op-amps — a raw shunt amp would need
  an external chip.
- F4 family CAN buffering is 3 TX mailboxes (needs a software TX queue to
  avoid blocking the safety path); G474's FDCAN has message RAM instead.
- G474 has the most ADCs of any candidate.
- H7 and the larger F4 parts (F429/F407, F413) pass everything too, but are
  bigger/pricier for no benefit here.
- G473 = same silicon family, same analog block, same CAN count. Fallback
  only, not a second option.

### Package

LQFP64 — enough pins for everything above, with spares for SWD/debug.

## CAN transceiver selection: TCAN1462V-Q1

Decision: **TCAN1462V-Q1** (SOIC-8, `TCAN1462VDRQ1`), on both CAN1 and CAN2.
VIO tied to the 3.3V rail (same rail as the STM32) for direct 3.3V logic
interfacing; VCC on the existing 5V rail.

### Isolation: not required

Checked against the actual rulebooks (`Reference Docs/FSUK Rules/`), not
assumption. FSG rule **EV 4.3.1**: "The entire TS and LVS must be galvanically
isolated" — this is a TS↔LVS boundary rule. Both CAN buses here are LVS-side
only (STM32 ↔ ECU/dashboard), already downstream of the one isolation
boundary that matters: the transformer-coupled daisy-chain link to the
BQ79600-Q1. Searched both rulebooks fully for "isolat"/"galvanic" — every
instance concerns the TS/LVS boundary (EV4.3.1) or component-level cases
(EV5.6.3, AIRs), never CAN. Confirmed by checking `FSAE_LSU_BMS` (a real FSAE
team's repo): their CAN nets are literally named `ISO_CAN1+/-`, but there's no
isolator component anywhere in their schematics or BOM — the name doesn't
mean what it implies.

### Requirements and candidates

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| 3.3V logic (VIO) | Must interface directly with the STM32G474's 3.3V GPIO, no external level shifter. |
| Automotive-grade (AEC-Q100) | Board sees vibration, heat near HV equipment, and electrical noise — not a bench/lab environment. |

Four candidates compared, specs pulled directly from each manufacturer's
datasheet (`Reference Docs/CAN Transceivers/`):

| | TCAN1462V-Q1 | TCAN1042V-Q1 | TJA1057 | MCP2562FD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VCC / VIO | 4.5-5.5V / 1.7-5.5V | 4.5-5.5V / 3.3V or 5V | 4.5-5.5V / 2.91-5.5V | 4.5-5.5V / 1.8-5.5V |
| Max data rate | 8 Mbps (CAN FD + SIC) | 2 Mbps (5 Mbps "G" suffix) | 5 Mbps (all but "T" variant) | 8 Mbps (CAN FD) |
| Bus fault tolerance | ±58V | ±58V (±70V "H" variant) | ±42V | Not confirmed |
| AEC-Q100 | Grade 1, confirmed | Grade 1, confirmed | Qualified, confirmed | **Not in datasheet** — marketing language only |
| Functional Safety docs | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Distinguishing feature | SIC — reduces ringing on multi-stub topologies | Direct TI/BQ79616 precedent | — | — |

### Why TCAN1462V-Q1 over TCAN1042V-Q1

Both are fully valid (same vendor, same AEC-Q100 grade, same Functional
Safety documentation). TCAN1462V-Q1 was chosen for **SIC** (Signal
Improvement Capability) — actively reduces bus ringing in networks with
multiple unterminated stubs, which fits a car harness with several CAN nodes
(BMS-Master, ECU, dashboard) branching off rather than a clean daisy chain.
MCP2562FD was ruled out for lacking confirmed AEC-Q100 qualification.
TJA1057 is AEC-Q100 qualified but has no Functional Safety documentation and
no SIC — ruled out in favor of staying in the same TI ecosystem as the rest
of the signal chain (BQ79600-Q1 → BQ79616 → TCAN1462V-Q1).
